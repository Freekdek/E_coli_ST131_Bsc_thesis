# [DRAFT] Whole genome typing methods for differentiating between epidemiologically related and unrelated E. coli ST131 isolates.
### Introduction 

Current typing methods have difficulty to distinguish epidemiologically related and unrelated E. coli ST131 samples. In the present study, the chewBBACA, PopPUNK, Snippy and whole multilocus sequence typing using Seqsphere were compared for their ability to discriminate related from unrelated E. coli ST131 isolates. 

### Methods 

E. coli ST131 isolates were defined as either related (same patient within 3 months) and unrelated (different institution). Draft E. coli ST131 genomes were obtained using Illumina sequencing and typed using the stable E. coli wgMLST scheme in Seqsphere, a specific E. coli ST131 wgMLST scheme in SeqSphere and in chewBBACA, PopPUNK, and Snippy. The medians of genetic distances were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and the correlation between the typing methods were subsequently calculated using the Spearman Rank correlation. Finally, the discriminatory power for each method was calculated at the following cutoffs: the percentage of misclassifications as related was determined at the lowest cutoff where all epidemiologically related were genetically classified as related. The percentage of misclassifications as unrelated at the highest cutoff where all epidemiologically unrelated were classified as genetically unrelated. 

### Results 

All tools except for chewBBACA showed a significant genetic distance difference between related and unrelated samples. The percentage of misclassifications at a cutoff which includes all related samples was approximately 40% for the wgMLST schemes, 20.9% for PopPUNK and 3.3% for Snippy. Excluding outliers, the misclassification was less than 1%, but chewBBACA remained unchanged. 

### Conclusion 

Contrary to expectation, the standard E. coli wgMLST scheme in Ridom SeqSphere is capable of distinguishing strictly defined related from unrelated samples and so do the other typing methods except for chewBBACA. For future study, the typing tools should be applied to a more realistic dataset with less strictly defined related and unrelated samples, to determine the discriminatory power at multiple cutoffs.
